# Pandas Challenge

## Project Background

### Background
In this challenge, you are the new Chief Data Scientist for your city's school district. In this capacity, you'll be helping the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.

As a first task, you've been asked to analyze the district-wide standardized test results. You'll be given access to every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. Your task is to aggregate the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance.

### Data source:
All used data in this project is provided by UNC Chapel Hillâ€™s Data Analytics and Visualization Bootcamp.

### Files:
The PyCitySchools folder contains all the files needed for this project.
- the Resources folder contains two files:
    - schools_complete.csv - has five columns containing data on the ID, name, type of school, size (number of students), and budget for each school.
    - students_complete.csv - has seven columns containing data on the ID number, name, gender, grade, school name, reading score, and math score for each student.
- PyCitySchools-Code.ipynb - contains all the code used to analyze data, answer project questions, and make visualizations. It also contains a short written analysis at the beginning of the file.
